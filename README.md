# MERN
In this repository, I learned how to implement all aspect of the MERN stack together, by building a ShoppingList page with User authentication.
Made sure to keep data available through different React components with the use of Redux.
Created the item and user authentication Api's with Jwt tokens and bycryptjs and stored information in MongoDB.

In Mern folder, run full app with:
  npm run dev
