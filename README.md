# MERN
In this repository, I learned how to implement all aspect of the MERN stack together, by building a ShoppingList page with User authentication.
Made sure to keep data available through different components with the use of Redux.
Created the user authentication Api's with Jwt tokens and bycryptjs.

To run full app enter:
  npm run dev
